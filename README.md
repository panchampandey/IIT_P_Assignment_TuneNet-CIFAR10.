#### This project focuses on hyperparameter tuning of a deep neural network classifier using the CIFAR-10 image dataset. The goal is to explore how different hyperparameters affect the model’s accuracy and performance in multi-class image classification.

#### 🔍 Key Objectives:
Understand and implement a deep learning pipeline using TensorFlow and Keras

Apply preprocessing techniques on CIFAR-10 images

Experiment with multiple hyperparameters (epochs, optimizers, layers, learning rates)

Analyze model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
Languages: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn

Dataset: CIFAR-10 (10-class image classification)

# 📊 Key Components:
